# Descripture
PriscillaAndAquila is a set of Windows scripts that can be executed via a hotkey that is listend for. The scripts will take the text that is currently highlighted, see if a verse reference is mentioned, then expound that verse reference with it's literal counterpart. 

For example, suppose the text looked like this before running PriscillaAndAquila:

```
Praise the Lord! He has made us alive together with Him!
Eph 2:5
```
After the scripts have been executed, the text will look like:

```
Praise the Lord! He has made us alive together with Him!
"Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)" - Eph 2:5
```


The Scripts will take the verse references, perform a lookup, and output and paste the entire verse with it's reference at the end.
